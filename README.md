From zero to hopefully hero in DevSecOps — everything I learned, scripted, and battle-tested.

**100% open source · No secrets leaked · Reproducible on any machine**

## What's Inside
- Universal tool installer (`devsecops-tools.sh`) — works locally & in CI
- Real GitHub Actions pipelines with SARIF results
- Vulnerable code samples (safe to scan)
- Cheat sheets & best practices
- Other tools as I progress
